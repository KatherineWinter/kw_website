# Presentations 
I've been reading about making good presentations. Here are my learnings:

## Presentation template

* Who is my audience? 
* What does the audience already know? 
* What does the audience care about?
  * What is my audience accountable for/what is their mission? How can this idea met their objective?
  * What is my audience passionate about right now? What are they craving?
  * What is my audience pain points?
* How do I want my audience to change? (What are they moving from, what should they move to?)
* What is the audience sacrifice to start your idea? (At min, previous held ideas) what is their perceived risk? (How will this stretch their time, etc)
* Why would they oppose this idea? State it
* State what the reward is
* What inspires the audience?
* What is the “big idea”? (Full sentence that’s has “you” in it)
* Is the presentation big idea going to inspire audience pain or pleasure?
* What is the call to action?
* What is a emotional story of the vision? 
* What is the data?
* What is the ethical value? Logical? Emotional?
* Start first with unquestionable fact
