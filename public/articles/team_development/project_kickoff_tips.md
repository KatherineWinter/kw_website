# Project Kickoff meeting tips

A Project Kickoff is the first meeting where development is about to begin. It’s a time to align on project expectations. This might be the first time people work or talk to each other. For that reason, it’s important that the everyone is on the same page.

## Before the meeting

- **Create a slack channel:** Create a channel specifically for the project. This identifies to each teammate who is on the project and a place to chat about it.
- **Project doc sent out:** Send the project doc to each person in the project a few days beforehand. Ideally, make it the Slack channel topic. Ask contributors to get familiar with the content. Let them ask questions. Let them chat amongst each other. The design & success metrics should be in the project doc.
- **Prototype:** If possible, let contributors create prototypes. This is possible during the two weeks that lead up to the project (cool down). This helps people wrap their mind around the project. It lets the contributors get familiar with the tasks required for the project.
- **Tasks broken down:** All known tasks should be submitted into a task manager (e.g. Pivotal, Github tasks). 
- **Low Confidence Estimates:** Get low confidences estimates to verify the project has a chance of fitting into the project’s time scope (usually 6 weeks). Pre-assigned by people’s interest. Verify people's allocation is balanced (total estimates allocated / total-time-allocated). (See Zoom example)
- **Send kickoff invite:** Send email out to everyone on project. Try to make a time everyone can make it. This is the “big meeting”. Include the project doc in the description. Ask everyone to please have a good understanding of it beforehand. 

Example:

    Kicking off the meeting Zoom & Apple SSO project.
    Please review the project document prior to the meeting:
    +project doc
    Task list -- low confidence estimates:
    +estimates sheet 


## During the meeting

- **Create kickoff doc:** [+TEMPLATE kick off meeting](./kickoff_meeting_template) Create a doc to be taking notes during the meeting. 
- **Show gratitude and enthusiasm:** Show gratitude and enthusiasm to your workmates and project. “Thank you everyone for being here, and for participating in this project. I’m very excited to work with you all.” Maybe point out this is/isn’t first time working with people. How this is a great opportunity to grow, etc.
- **Address project doc:** Ask everyone if they have a good understanding of the project doc. If there are any questions about what the project is about — address it. Quickly move on if not.
- **Go through the kickoff doc:** Make sure everyone is having an opportunity to speak. This is an opportunity to set the “mood” of the project, create team culture, and set team expectations.
- **Remind everyone they rock. To be patient with themselves & others:** This might be the first time people are working together. It’s not easy to work with someone new. Address that everyone is awesome, and that we are all trying our best. No one is trying to drop the ball. Be patient with others, and be patient with yourself. It’s ok to not know something. That’s why it’s a NEW project. There are plenty of unknowns, and we will get through it together.
