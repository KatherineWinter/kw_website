# Slack empathy office

At EA we would use status icons to communicate how we feeling. We were [inspired by this article](https://alexascordato.com/my-new-empathy-office/).

We added a few more colors than what is included in the article:
* Purple: I'm super focused - don't talk to me
* Blue: I'm in a meeting(?) I actually don't really remember what blue was.  Perhaps blue was more for people who are sitting next to you. Frostbite loaned us noise cancelling headphones that basically looked like we work in an airfield, so it was near impossible to know when people are listening to music vs. in a meeting vs. focused. I guess it's useful for when people are calling you on slack and you are in a google hangout for your slack icon.
