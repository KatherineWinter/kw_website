The document attempts to decode listening practices to make it easier to listen. 

# Pre-work in communicating (when communicating through disagreement or a group)

* Identify your objective - Set the goals of the conversation. What are you trying to achieve in the conversation?
* Address culture conflicts
    * Recognize cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings.
    * Be aware of your own cultural perspective, and perhaps be ready to share your own cultural experience. (e.g., sharing certain beliefs). Sharing cultural experience can open the door to get others to share their experiences.
    * Foster acceptance & create psychological safety: Allow everyone to be themselves.
    * Exercies: Identify 3 ways your culture infludneces you in the workplace and how it appears in conflict.
* Help quiet people speak up (and don’t let the talkers dominate): Many hesitate to voice their opinions in meetings due to intimidation, fear, politics, or personality. However, their insights can be valuable. To involve them, consider “warm calling” before the meeting, prepping them to share their views--asking them to share a particular view before the meeting starts. Supporting their input during the meeting fosters a collaborative environment. Encouraging group discussions leverages collective wisdom, allowing for a richer exchange of ideas.
* Keep an open mind to new solutions: Have you "always done it this way?" Perhaps it is time to see things from a new point of view. Perhaps issues are coming up because it was not resolved well to begin with. Envision the possibilities, list pros + cons, ask yourself "what would like look like if we did things differently?", breathe.

# Strategic listening

In the course “Communicating through Disagreement” (Hurdle, 2022), suggests a great tactic on what to focus on while listening instead of queuing up a response in your mind:

* **Issues and facts:** What are they concerned about? Isolate only the facts as they see them.
* **Feelings:** Find the feeling that is beneath the words that they aren’t verbalizing
* **Values:** What is the value that has been violated? What value is the person protecting?
* **Positions:** Where does the person stand? What statement are they saying that indicates one of the other categories isn’t being fulfilled?

# Listening considerations

* Avoid Tone Policing: Refusing to take in information based on the other person's tone of voice. (e.g., "Don't take that tone with me!" or "I cannot talk with you when you are talking that way."). Try to adopt. Consider that people come from different cultures and what is consider rude for some is a cultural norm for others. To check in if you are naturally policing someone's tone, check your body language. Are your arms crossed? Are you making a face? Are you tense? Identify what turns you off about tones. "If you want to resolve a conflict, you might have to let the tone go and listen for the content." (Hurdle, 2021).
* No name-calling: Avoid name-calling out loud or even in your mind. (e.g., "that's silly/stupid.", "you're working too slow.", anything with "crazy"). Instead say something like, "that sounds like something I've never heard before. Say more about that, please."
* Do not interrupt - resist the urge: When you interrupt, you assume what the person will say, and you communicate that what you have to say is more important. "If you keep interrupting, you'll never hear the issues or know what you have to resolve." (Hurdle, 2021)
* Listen for content, not how it makes you feel. Focus on understanding what they are saying.
    * Recognize getting diverted: Has your mind wandered off? Are you reflecting on a past conflict? Did you hear something triggering?
    * Recognize making judgements: Judgment happens because we are processing millions of things a moment. The brain automatically stores the information into categories. These categories lead to bias and judgment. "You start to judge when someone says something that goes against your own beliefs." (Hurdle, 2021). Judgment gets in the way of what the other person is saying. Here are tips to avoid passing judgment:
        * Pay attention and catch yourself making judgments. Why are you judging? Did they say something you didn't like or go against your values?
        * Ask clarifying questions to gather more information.
        * Practice! Listen to a newscast that you disagree with. Notice when you make a judgment. Pay attention to the content and understanding the content.
* Using [“minimal encouragers”](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/communicating-through-disagreement-2022/learning-from-hostage-negotiators?autoSkip=true&resume=false&u=2157642) — small signs that you are listening.

# Gathering information

* Put yourself in a calm state: Breathe in for a count of four, and hold for four counts. Taking a moment to breathe will help avoid interrupting.
* [Mirroring/repeating](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/communicating-through-disagreement-2022/learning-from-hostage-negotiators?autoSkip=true&resume=false&u=2157642) the person’s issue with a question — this volunteers more information.
* Try asking 5 [open-ended questions](coaching.md) before proposing a solution. If you are prepping for feedback, draft the questions ahead of time. Example:
    * Kim: "You're never really available, Jane."
    * Jane: "What does more availability look like to you?"
* Paraphrase: "So if I heard this right, you suggest we try..."
* "Tell me more" + open ended question)[coaching.md]
* [Use "Yes, and…" or "Interesting, and..."](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/communicating-through-disagreement-2022/setting-the-stage-for-agreement?resume=false&u=2157642) instead of Yes, but…
* I know what you believe, but [what do you need from me](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/communicating-through-disagreement-2022/what-do-they-need?autoSkip=true&resume=false&u=2157642) in this conversation?

# Inputting/Responding

* When communicating through disagreement, recognize you could be wrong.
* Aggressive vs. assertive statements: Assertive statements are the foundation of healthy resolution. (TASK statements - Be specific about what you want to see - generate the feedback to hit all of these points: Timely, Actionable, Specific, and Kind (TASK)).
    * Aggressive statements: Meant to force people to do something. (e.g., "Just get the work done and don't ask any questions.")
    * Assertive statements: State what you need in a respective way. (e.g., "I need the work done by 3 pm. Let's take 10 minutes for questions.")
* Passive vs. peaceful: Passive is not sharing your opinion. Strategies to standing up for yourself in conflict:
    * Setting ground rules at the outset. (e.g., All ideas are acceptable, no name calling, no interrupting)
    * Find common ground - ask a question you both can answer: "What does respect look like to you?"
    * Share your opinion, let it known how strongly you hold the opinion. "My [strongly/loosely] held opinion is..."
* Uplifting ideas - encourage people to give ideas by
    * Setting ground rules at the outset. (e.g., All ideas are acceptable, no name calling, no interrupting)
    * Using encouraging language. (e.g., "That's great", "Let's keep it coming.", "let's look at it from another angle.")
    * *****If you are leading a group discussion, be the last one to contribute your ideas. By speaking first, you may intimidating people or influencing people. Here are a few examples to gather perspectives:
        * "We've got a good start here. What more can we come up with?"
        * "What's a different take on this?"
    * Make it safe for people to take risks: Foster a climate of psychological safety where individuals feel free to share work-related thoughts and feelings. To create such a climate, lead by example (“Let me just throw out a risky idea...“); support those who try (“I really appreciate you suggesting...“); and sanction those who ridicule others (“I don’t want that kind of language here...“).
* [Allow the person to save face](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/communicating-through-disagreement-2022/excelling-with-hostage-negotiation-tips?autoSkip=true&resume=false&u=2157642) — remark on how difficult the situation is.
* Playing devil’s advocate: Useful for ensure all options are explored, but be clear that is the role you are playing.
* "Cultivate transparent advocates (and get rid of the hard sellers)" (Hansen, 2018): When proposing idea, include the downsides of an idea. This ensures the idea is not oversold, and helps erase biases on the idea.

# Closing

Check to see if conflict is resolved before moving on
* Is everyone walking away feeling like they've been heard?
* Does everyone feel better than when they started talking about the conflict? People don't have to be satisifed, but they do need to feel like the now is better than the before state.
* Did you test the solutions to make sure they're doable? Is there a timeline for looping back to question the solution?
