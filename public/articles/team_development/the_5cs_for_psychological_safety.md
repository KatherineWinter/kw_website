# The 5cs for Psychological safety
I went to this webinar today:[ Webinar Signup! How to Create Psychological Safety at Work Using the 5CS](https://info.kainexus.com/continuous-improvement/how-to-create-psychological-safety-at-work-using-the-5cs/webinar/signup). Here are my notes from it:

## Clear expectations:

* What do I do day-to-day?
* Am I expected to raise problems?
* What is the mission?
* How do we treat each other?
* How do we turn up in meetings?
* What does my leader expect from me?

## Connecting regularly

* Must connect often with each other
* The more we see each other, the closer we feel to them
* Need close connection to feel psychologically safe
* We will follow someone’s lead if we have a connection with them
* The more connection, the better. The easier it is to check-in, and align on the expectation
* Try to connect x2 more often than you normally would
* Build into the beginning of the meeting - informal. BUILD IT INTO THE SCHEDULE.

## Caring genuinely

* People are good at reading others. They know when it is faked.
* Don’t lose side of the people side of initiatives
* Focus on the people and the processes. People first.
* How to care genuinely? Connect regularly.
* Practice empathy - ask questions. Reflect back on what you are hearing. Ask questions that you understand correctly. 

## Consistent kindness

* Kindness comes from empathy — compassion. Builds trust
* Fear - comes from unkindness
* Are our words helping others, or causing fear?
* When there is fear, people do not ask questions.
* Must be consistent. It only takes one time to spoil trust and builds fear.
* Consistency creates predictability. People feel safe when they feel like they can predict things.
* If you do have a bad day, bring it back up and address it

## Coregulate

* The model for what the mood should be
* Leads regulate their emotions, so reports can emulate that mood

## Exercises:

* Turn on the TV to an opinion piece where they have the opposite view as you. Write down how you feel. Do you feel closed off / closed-minded? Write down why they think what they think. Write down - guess why they think that way.
