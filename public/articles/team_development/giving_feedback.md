# Giving Feedback

It is common to give feedback often and quickly in the corporate world. However, are ideal feedback formats? The goal of this article is to decode common feedback situations.

## Formal feedback
Corporates typically have an annual or bi-annual feedback cycle. Often the feedback request is vague or blank. In this case, try the format "The Good, Opportunities, and Overall." This format usually covers all bases of what people were looking for but didn't ask. You will look like a feedback superhero. Under each section, start a bulleted list of everything you think of when you think of the person. Once the list is complete, try to put it in sentence form.

### Fictional example:

THE GOOD
You did an excellent job in the meetings this week. When Sandra seemed confused about the expectations for the project, you did an excellent job of course correcting the situation. I liked how you asked her about her current understanding of the project before trying to guide her. That shows artful skills in emotional intelligence.

OPPORTUNITIES
You get excited about projects and execute them very quickly. You could improve our organization and multiply your efforts by documenting as you go along. That way, if you are on PTO, we are completely recovered. It is an excellent opportunity to show your leadership skills by making leaders out of others.

OVERALL
You are an AWESOME teammate. I love how you care about the success of this project. That excitement is contagious!


## Giving Crucial Feedback
Giving crucial feedback is always challenging. Usually, crucial feedback is unprompted and must be timely to be effective. However, there is a simple formula to make the experience more accessible. The following are ideal steps for feedback success:

1. Think to yourself, "Is this the right time for feedback? Why am I giving them feedback now?"
1. Ask if the other person is open to feedback before giving the feedback.
1. Have a specific example.
1. Do not make the feedback personal (i.e., phrase it as how this was not about them, but about you, "The way X impacted me.. or "This is less about you, but more about how I took X situation… "). Remember, this may not be how they see themselves or others see it. It is how it landed with you.
1. Identify how it was impacting you/the team.
1. Be specific about what you would like to see - keep in mind the "TASK" acronym (stands for Timely, Actionable, Specific, and Kind) and ensure that I'm hitting all 4 points.

### Fictional example:

**Me:** “Hi Ryan, are you open for feedback?”
**Ryan:** “yes”
**Me:** “This has to do with my perception, not you, but during the bug bash and this morning, I have been reading your responses as a little more defensive than curious. E.g.

* During the bug bash, when I asked if we had any logging on why a game didn’t download, you said no, and moved on. I didn’t feel you were open to hearing why we might find that valuable or having my concern resolved.
* During our conversation now, when I’m asked about the “download queue,” I read your responses as “no.”

I think it would be helpful if you invited me to express my POV and why I believe it is crucial. Then help me understand your POV or what missing information I have. It makes me feel like you are not open to hearing what I have to say. What are your thoughts?

I’m letting you know this because I value our relationship! I hope this doesn’t feel like an attack. As I said, this is more about me than you.”
