From a few books i have read regarding giving critical feedback:

1. Think to self, “Is this the right time for feedback? Why am I giving them feedback now?”
1. Ask if other person is open to feedback before giving the feedback
1. Do not make the feedback personal (ie. phrase it on how this was not about me, but about you “The way X impacted me.. or “This is less about you, but more about how I took X situation…“)
1. Have a specific example
1. Identify how it was impacting you/the team
1. Be specific of what you would like to see

## Fictional example:

**Me:** “Hi Ryan, are you open for feedback?”
**Ryan:** “yes”
**Me:** “This has to do with my perception not you, but during the bug bash and this morning, I have been reading your responses as a little defensive than curious. E.g.

* During the bug bash, when I asked if we had any logging on why a game didn’t download, you said no, and moved on. I didn’t feel like you were open to hear why we might find that valuable, or have my concern resolved.
* During our conv now, when I’m asking about the “download queue”, I’m reading your responses as “no”.

I think it would be helpful if you invited me to express my POV and why I think it is important. Then help me understand your POV or what missing information I have. It makes me feel like you are not open to hearing what I have to say. What are your thoughts?”

**Me:** “I’m letting you know this because I value our relationship! I hope this doesn’t feel like an attack. Like I said, this is more about me than you.”
