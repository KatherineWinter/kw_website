# Giving Feedback

It is common to give feedback often and quickly in the corporate world. However, what are ideal feedback formats? The goal of this article is to decode informal and formal feedback situations.

## Formal feedback
Corporations typically have an annual or bi-annual feedback cycle. Often the feedback request is vague or blank. In this case, try the format "The Good, Opportunities, and Overall." This format usually covers all bases of what people sought but didn't ask. You will look like a feedback superhero. Under each section, start a bulleted list of everything you think of when you think of the person. Once the list is complete, try to put it in sentence form.

**Fictional example**

THE GOOD
You did an excellent job in meetings this week. When Sandra seemed confused about the expectations for the project, you did a fantastic job, of course, correcting the situation. I liked how you asked her about her current understanding of the project before trying to guide her. That shows artful skills in emotional intelligence.

OPPORTUNITIES
You get excited about projects and execute them very quickly. You could improve our organization and multiply your efforts by documenting as you go along. That way, if you are on PTO, we are entirely covered. It is an excellent opportunity to show your leadership skills by making leaders out of others.

OVERALL
You are an AWESOME teammate. I love how you care about the success of this project. That excitement is contagious!


## Giving Crucial Feedback
Giving crucial feedback is always challenging. Below are a few tips on the approach to creating a productive conversation:

1. Be clear about what conversation outcome. Don't give special treatment to an employee.
1. Slow down the pace of the conversation — it helps you find the right words and signals to your counterpart that you’re listening.
1. Don't be afraid of silence during the conversation. Don't jump in with filler comments because you are uncomfortable. The silence will give the other person time to reflect on the information and come back with their perspective. You will learn more about the situation and the other person. “If your counterpart has stopped responding to you, you can simply say, 'I don’t know how to interpret your silence.'” [(Carmichael, 2010)](https://hbr.org/2010/10/difficult-conversations-9-common-mistakes)
1. Stay focused on the issue and future results. Do not sugar code the information. Keep the conversation focused on the impact or business needs. Talking about the actions needed to achieve the future keeps the conversation positive. Focusing on the future may also keep the other person motivated.
1. Keep emotion in check. Rather than channeling your emotion, instead, label it. E.g., "I felt frustrated by X." On the same coin, mention it if you see them channeling emotions. E.g., "You seemed concerned about X; would you tell me more?"
1. Conduct the conversation in a new space. Going offsite and away from the working environment may create a safer neutral space.
1. If possible, have the conversation face to face rather than over chat or email. Seeing the person's expressions ensures you are on the same page.
1. Change your mindset. Don't label the conversation as difficult, but a normal conversation about growth.
1. Don't build a script. The conversation may take an unexpected turn, and you may be caught off guard and come across as artificial. Be ready for multiple responses. The language should be clear, direct, and neutral.
1. Keep an open mind. The other person will have a different perspective on the situation. "What is the problem? What does the other person think is the problem? If you aren’t sure of the other person’s viewpoint, acknowledge that you don’t know and ask.” [(Knight, 2015)](https://hbr.org/2015/01/how-to-handle-difficult-conversations-at-work)


### Consider Your Relationship (care/candor checklist)

Don't avoid having a crucial conversation if you have a working relationship with someone or have a stake in their development. However, if neither is the case, consider if you are the best person to have a candor conversation with. I have been burnt by giving feedback to someone who did not know me or my intentions and me not knowing their situation. For that reason, I do follow the care/candor checklist that is outlined in the book The 5 Levels of Leadership and listed on [Maxwell's (2010)](https://www.johnmaxwell.com/blog/for-leaders-balancing-care-with-candor/) website:

1. Have I invested enough in the relationship to be candid with them?
1. Do I truly value this person?
1. Am I sure this is their issue and not mine?
1. Am I sure I am not speaking up because I feel threatened?
1. Is the issue more important than the relationship?
1. Does this conversation clearly serve their interests and not just mine?
1. Am I willing to invest time and energy to help them change?
1. Am I willing to show them how to do something, not just say what is wrong?
1. Am I willing and able to set clear, specific expectations?


### Feedback Formula

Usually, crucial feedback is unprompted and must be timely to be effective. However, there is a simple formula to make the experience more accessible. The following are ideal steps for feedback success:

1. Think to yourself, "Is this the right time for feedback? Why am I giving them feedback now? Do I have the relationship to have a candor conversation with this person? Is this a pet peeve or having a real performance impact?" If you have a pet peeve, make that clear.
1. Ask if the other person is open to feedback before giving the feedback.
1. Have a specific example.
1. Do not make the feedback personal (i.e., phrase it as how this was not about them, but about you, "The way X impacted me.. or "This is less about you, but more about how I took X situation… "). Remember, this may not be how they see themselves or others see it. It is how it landed with you.
1. Identify how it was impacting you/the team.
1. Be specific about what you want to see - remember the "TASK" acronym (Timely, Actionable, Specific, and Kind). Ensure that you hit all 4 points.
1. Ask them for their perspective by asking an open-ended question. Have empathy and listen. Pay attention to their body language and tone of voice. The goal is to understand what is important to them and to understand their point of view. As mentioned, your perspective is not their perspective. The open-ended question will open the conversation and may prevent the person from being defensive.
1. Agree on the summary, next steps, and timeline of follow-up.

**Fictional example**

**Me:** “Hi Ryan, are you open for feedback?”
**Ryan:** “Yes”
**Me:** “I want to give you this feedback because I value our relationship and want us to be aligned in conversations moving forward. This has to do with my perception, not you, but during the bug bash and this morning, I have been reading your responses as a little more defensive than curious. For example, when I asked if we had any logging on why a game didn't download during the bug bash, you said no and swiftly moved on to another topic. I didn’t feel you were open to hearing why we might find that valuable or having my concern resolved.

Slowing down in conversations would open up the floor for people like myself to express their opinions. Before moving on to another topic, please give me a moment to say my POV and why I believe it is crucial. Then help me understand your POV or what missing information I have. What are your thoughts?”

## Formula to Handle Receiving Emotionally Charged Feedback

[I like this article](https://hbr.org/2016/01/defusing-an-emotionally-charged-conversation-with-a-colleague) on handling emotionally charged conversations and utilizing the PEARLS approach. The article discusses how discussions can escalate quickly when the task and relationship channels are mixed.

“task-focused disagreement becomes contaminated with concerns about our relationship. And when that happens, things escalate. Fast.”

The PEARLS approach is a great formula for handling emotionally charged:

* **Partnership:**
  * “I really want to work on this with you.”
  * “I bet we can figure this out together.”
* **Empathy:**
  * “I can feel your enthusiasm as you talk.”
  * “I can hear your concern.”
* **Acknowledgement:**
  * “You clearly put a lot of work into this.”
  * “You invested in this, and it shows.”
* **Respect:**
  * “I’ve always appreciated your creativity.”
  * “There’s no doubt you know a lot about this.”
* **Legitimation:**
  * “This would be hard for anyone.”
  * “Who wouldn’t be worried about something like this?”
* **Support:**
  * “I’d like to help you with this.”
  * “I want to see you succeed.”
