# Giving Feedback

In the professional realm, offering feedback is integral to the growth and development process. However, striking a balance between constructive and critical can be challenging. This article aims to navigate through the complexities of feedback, dissecting the methods, timing, and strategies that ensure both effectiveness and receptivity. The focus ranges from the structure of formal feedback to the nuanced art of crucial, unsolicited feedback to provide a comprehensive understanding of best practices in corporate communication. A quick disclaimer is I’m an American. Some of these strategies and tactics are likely culture-dependent. If you are in a high-context culture, say a Japanese company, explicit and direct feedback may not be productive. Please bear with me as I discuss the principles, and then you can figure out the best way to adapt them to your cultural context. For the rest of this article, let’s all be Americans.

## Giving Formal Feedback
Corporations typically have an annual or bi-annual feedback cycle. Often the feedback request is vague or blank. In this case, try the format "The Good, Opportunities, and Overall." This format usually covers all bases of what people sought but didn't ask. You will look like a feedback superhero. Under each section, start a bulleted list of everything you think of when you think of the person. Once the list is complete, try to put it in sentence form.

**Fictional example**

THE GOOD

You did an excellent job in meetings this week. When Sandra seemed confused about the expectations for the project, you did a fantastic job, of course, correcting the situation. I liked how you asked her about her current understanding of the project before trying to guide her. That shows artful skills in emotional intelligence.

OPPORTUNITIES

You get excited about projects and execute them very quickly. You could improve our organization and multiply your efforts by documenting as you go along. That way, if you are on PTO, we are entirely covered. It is an excellent opportunity to show your leadership skills by making leaders out of others.

OVERALL

You are an AWESOME teammate. I love how you care about the success of this project. That excitement is contagious!


## Strategies for Giving Crucial Feedback
Giving crucial feedback is always challenging. Below are a few tips on the approach to creating a productive conversation:

1. Consider the culture of the person you are giving feedback to. Are they used to high-context cultures? What is the 'power-distance' in the culture? Check out the [Hofstede Insights Country Comparison Tool](https://www.hofstede-insights.com/country-comparison-tool) to prepare for the conversation, which gives a studied difference in cultural differences between two countries. Understand the cultural background and norms when planning your strategy. (Again, this article is targeted at low-context cultures).
1. Consider the needs of the other person. Neurodiversity individuals have different ways of processing feedback. Everyone has a different learning style. Consider learning their style and tailoring the conversation.
1. Be clear about the desired outcome of the conversation. Don't give special treatment to an employee.
1. Slow down the pace of the conversation — it helps you find the right words and signals to your counterpart that you’re listening.
1. Don't be afraid of silence during the conversation. Don't jump in with filler comments because you are uncomfortable. The silence will give the other person time to reflect on the information and come back with their perspective. You will learn more about the situation and the other person. “If your counterpart has stopped responding to you, you can simply say, 'I don’t know how to interpret your silence.'” [(Carmichael, 2010)](https://hbr.org/2010/10/difficult-conversations-9-common-mistakes)
1. Stay focused on the issue and future results. Do not sugarcoat the information. Keep the conversation focused on the impact or business needs. Talking about the actions needed to achieve the future keeps the conversation positive. Focusing on the future may also keep the other person motivated.
1. Keep emotion in check. Rather than channeling your emotion, instead, label it. E.g., "I felt frustrated by X." On the same coin, mention it if you see them channeling emotions. E.g., "You seemed concerned about X; would you tell me more?"
1. Conduct the conversation in a new space. Going offsite and away from the working environment may create a safer neutral space.
1. If possible, have the conversation face to face rather than over chat or email. Seeing the person's expressions ensures you are on the same page.
1. Change your mindset. Don't label the conversation as difficult, but a normal conversation about growth.
1. Don't build a script. The conversation may take an unexpected turn, and you may be caught off guard and come across as artificial. Be ready for multiple responses. The language should be clear, direct, and neutral.
1. Keep an open mind. The other person will have a different perspective on the situation. "What is the problem? What does the other person think is the problem? If you aren’t sure of the other person’s viewpoint, acknowledge that you don’t know and ask.” [(Knight, 2015)](https://hbr.org/2015/01/how-to-handle-difficult-conversations-at-work)
1. Document the feedback given and the result. Hopefully, you will not need it for later, but you never know.


### Assessing the Relationship Before Giving Feedback (care/candor checklist)

Don't avoid having a crucial conversation if you have a working relationship with someone or have a stake in their development. However, if neither is the case, consider if you are the best person to have a candor conversation with. Giving feedback to someone who didn't know me or my intentions and whose situation I didn't understand has burnt me before. For that reason, I do follow the care/candor checklist that is outlined in the book The 5 Levels of Leadership and listed on [Maxwell's (2010)](https://www.johnmaxwell.com/blog/for-leaders-balancing-care-with-candor/) website:

1. Have I invested enough in the relationship to be candid with them?
1. Do I truly value this person?
1. Am I sure this is their issue and not mine?
1. Am I sure I am not speaking up because I feel threatened?
1. Is the issue more important than the relationship?
1. Does this conversation clearly serve their interests and not just mine?
1. Am I willing to invest time and energy to help them change?
1. Am I willing to show them how to do something, not just say what is wrong?
1. Am I willing and able to set clear, specific expectations?


### Feedback Formula

Usually, crucial feedback is unprompted and must be timely to be effective. However, there is a simple formula to make the experience more accessible. The following are ideal steps for feedback success:

1. Think to yourself, "Is this the right time for feedback? Why am I giving them feedback now? Do I have the relationship to have a candor conversation with this person? Is this a pet peeve or having a real performance impact?" If you have a pet peeve, make that clear.
1. Ask if the other person is open to feedback before giving the feedback.
1. Have a specific example.
1. Do not make the feedback personal (i.e., phrase it as how this was not about them, but about you, "The way X impacted me.. or "This is less about you, but more about how I took X situation… "). Remember, this may not be how they see themselves or others see it. It is how it landed with you.
1. Identify how it was impacting you/the team.
1. Be specific about what you want to see - generate the feedback to hit all of these points: Timely, Actionable, Specific, and Kind (TASK).
1. Ask them for their perspective by asking an open-ended question. Have empathy and listen. Pay attention to their body language and tone of voice. The goal is to understand what is important to them and to understand their point of view. As mentioned, your perspective is not their perspective. The open-ended question will open the conversation and may prevent the person from being defensive.
1. Agree on the summary, next steps, and timeline of follow-up.

The following is a fictional example of applying the formula:

**Me:** “Hi Ryan, are you open for feedback?”
**Ryan:** “Yes”
**Me:** “I want to give you this feedback because I value our relationship and want us to be aligned in conversations moving forward. This feedback concerns my perception, not you, but during the bug bash and this morning, I have been reading your responses as a little more defensive than curious. For example, when I asked if we had any logging on why a game didn't download during the bug bash, you said no and swiftly moved on to another topic. I didn’t feel you were open to hearing why we might find that valuable or having my concern resolved.

Slowing down in conversations would open up the floor for people like myself to express their opinions. Before moving on to another topic, please give me a moment to say my POV and why I believe it is crucial. Then help me understand your POV or what missing information I have. What are your thoughts?”

## Receiving Feedback

Just as important as giving feedback is the art of receiving feedback. The same cultural, neurodiversity and personal factors apply, and it's just as crucial to be an effective recipient of feedback as it is to give it. As described above, giving feedback is also challenging and uncomfortable for the giver. Therefore, keep an open mind and view it as a gift. Just like a gift, you don't have to do anything with the feedback, but there may be consequences for not accepting it. Therefore, agreeing on the summary, next steps, and follow-up timeline is crucial. [Friedman (2016)](https://hbr.org/2016/01/defusing-an-emotionally-charged-conversation-with-a-colleague) has a great article on handling emotionally charged conversations and utilizing the PEARLS approach. The report points out that discussions can escalate quickly when we mix task and relationship channels.

“Task-focused disagreement becomes contaminated with concerns about our relationship. And when that happens, things escalate. Fast.”

The article describes the Partnership, Empathy, Acknowledgment, Legitimation, and Support (PEARLS) approach for handling emotionally charged:

* **Partnership:**
  * “I really want to work on this with you.”
  * “I bet we can figure this out together.”
* **Empathy:**
  * “I can feel your enthusiasm as you talk.”
  * “I can hear your concern.”
* **Acknowledgment:**
  * “You clearly put a lot of work into this.”
  * “You invested in this, and it shows.”
* **Respect:**
  * “I’ve always appreciated your creativity.”
  * “There’s no doubt you know a lot about this.”
* **Legitimation:**
  * “This would be hard for anyone.”
  * “Who wouldn’t be worried about something like this?”
* **Support:**
  * “I’d like to help you with this.”
  * “I want to see you succeed.”

## Overall

In conclusion, giving and receiving feedback is critical to professional growth and development. No matter the feedback type, it demands a thoughtful, insightful, and well-structured approach. However, it's important to remember that the art of feedback is a nuanced skill that requires practice and continuous learning. As we expect growth from those receiving feedback, we, too, must strive to evolve as effective feedback providers.

Now, it's your turn to bring these insights to life. Use one technique from this guide in your next feedback session. Don't shy away from those difficult conversations. Instead, embrace them as unique opportunities for mutual growth and improved communication. Remember, each feedback session is a step toward mastering this vital professional skill.

So, why wait? Start reshaping your feedback strategy today. Step into your next feedback session with a renewed perspective and watch as it transforms into a productive, insightful, and growth-inspiring conversation.
