# Customer Support, QA, and product team communications

The cross communication between Product Managers, Customer Support, QA, and Dev is a fragile ecosystem that needs to be maintained.

## What is the process that works?

1. Support Project Manager (QA manager) and Customer Support Manager watches Zendesk cost dashboard. They investigate what the symptoms of the top issues are, and prioritize them in the [Support Queue](support_queue). 
1. Product Managers assign a [Support engineer](sprint_support_engineer) in the workplan to work through the [Support Queue](support_queue). 
1. When an issue or bug appears in Customer Support, the follow steps are taken:
    - CS sends a message to the Support Project Manager.
    - The bug is put in the[Support Queue](support_queue).
    - CS advocates to Support Project Manager for itâ€™s priority
1. The [Support engineer](sprint_support_engineer) would be following the priorities detailed in [Support Engineer Priorities](sprint_support_engineer) and then be working off the support queue that Support Project Manager prioritize. 
1. [Support engineer](sprint_support_engineer)s would be meeting with QA in their slack channel to discuss the priorities and give updates on progress.
1. When fixes are deployed the Support Engineer notifies Customer Support. 
1. When issues are fixed, Customer Support contacts impacted users.
