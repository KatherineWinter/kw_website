1. You start making progress on the idea.
1. You start building other people to run the idea.
1. Someone else is running the idea.

### How do I empower others to take action?
* Be a leader.
* Set a clear vision, strategy, and goals on an initiative that matters to you.
* Tie it all together.


## What is a leader?

Leaders grow and inspire others.


## How do I become a leader?

### Step 1. Understand yourself

**Understand your own motivations, interests, strengths, and weaknesses.**

> If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.
> ― Sun Tzu, The Art of War

Create a document for yourself where you list out:

- **Interests:** What do you enjoy doing? What do you not enjoy doing?
- **Motivations:** Problems you see, why it’s important, and possible next steps.
- **Ambitions:** Write out your goals. Have outward goals (goals that benefit others — not yourself). Be a change agent. Help align organization on: vision, values, relationships, attitude, and communication.
    - What are your short-term goals?
    - What are your long-term goals?
    - Why is it important?
- **Strengths:** What do you excel at?
- **Weakness:** What do you struggle with? Ask your friends and colleagues to point out your blind spots.


### Step 2. Build/have relationships
> If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader
> -- John Quincy Adams

People will only follow people they respect. Take the time to get to know your teammate. 

- What are their interests, motivations, and ambitions?
- What are their strengths and weaknesses?
- How can you help your teammate achieve their goals?
- Help your teammate identify what their strengths are
- Complement your strengths & weakness against teammate strengths & weakness.
    - Have your teammate “pass the ball” when they are outside of their strength (unless, they are interested in building that weakness)
- Develop your teammates as leaders. Knowledge share with them - Teach, share, and build each other. We are strongest when we work and grow together.
> Victory is much more meaningful when it comes not just from one person, but from the joint achievements of many. The euphoria is lasting when all participants lead with their hearts, winning not just for themselves but for one another.
> -- Howard Schultz, Starbucks founder

### Step 3. Empower your teammates by giving direction
- Constantly communicate the vision / strategy / goals. Frequent reminders help team members see the big picture more clearly.
- Delegate when you can. If someone can do something 80% as well as you, have them do it. This helps them learn, and empowers them to build others.
- Guide teammates to success - Unblocking, redirecting questions, setting expectations, and sharing ideas for next steps

## How to set clear vision on an initiative that matters to you

From your motivations/interests/strengths/weaknesses doc, identify initiatives and changes you would like to see. Now set a vision for what good looks like for one of those changes. 

### Create a [Vision Document](vision_template)

What is a ‘vision’ document? A document describes a compelling idea, project or other future state for a particular organization, product or service. Consumers of the document are customers, and must ‘buy in’ to the idea for it to be an effective vision. Vision is a mission. A vision shows how short term work connects with the long term.

**Gather requirements from stakeholders.** Stakeholders are people who would be impacted by the change. Do they support this change? Do you have missing information that changes the vision?


### Write strategies on how to achieve the vision

Strategies are the action items of how the vision is achieved.
Continue work and align with your stakeholders.


### Write goals of the strategies

Having clear goals of the strategies helps define what explicitly “good” looks like in action. [How to write a SMART goal.](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm)

- What is the timeline?
- What metrics should be met? 
- What actionable items need to be done?

Write this all out in a strategy document. Continue work and align with your stakeholders.


## How to tie it all together
- Understand yourself
- Build your relationships - People buy into the leader, then the vision.
- Set a vision of what you want to see changed
    - See [Vision Template](vision_template)
    - Align with your stakeholders on this vision
    - Work with stakeholders on setting the strategies
    - Work with stakeholders on setting setting clear goals
    - Investigate and write clear guidelines on the timelines / resources it takes to achieve the goal. 
- Continuously build others to own that vision
