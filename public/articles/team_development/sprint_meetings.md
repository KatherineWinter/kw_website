# Sprint meetings 
There are critical meetings in a sprint that support its success. This document contains points out:
* What those meetings are
* Who should be included
* What is involved.

## Backlog grooming
* Who: the whole team
* A backlog contains upcoming tasks.
* The backlog would have a section for "New requirements" and "Groomed Backlog".
* Backlog would contain upcoming work items with estimations and breakdowns.
* "New requirements" are items that still need to be groomed and broken down in the backlog.
* Tasks in the Groomed Backlog would contain a description of what the task was. They would be broken down by workflow design work, tech design, implementation, finalization -- as needed.
* Once a sprint, the team would groom the backlog, estimate how difficult each task would on average. Point out missing information from the task description. (This gives the PM/Epic Lead/Manager an idea of how expensive a project is going to be, take that info to the exec, and prepare the information needed ahead of time for the project to be easier)

## Sprint task pre-populating
* Who: PM/epic lead/manager
* PM/Epic lead/Managers would align with stakeholders on what the deliverables given the timeline.
* Prior to sprint pre-planning the Pm/Epic lead/manager would pre-populate the sprint with items they would like to see completed. Items can be added/removed. This list would be in priority order.

## Sprint pre-planning
* Who: the whole team
* Pre-planning: engineers would volunteer for the tasks that interest them of the pre-populated list. Also, voice and concerns
* After pre-planning and during investigation: Engineers can reach out to stakeholders/pms/epic leads/manager on any missing information that would impact the task. Talk to leadership if the task isn't going to fit into the sprint.

## Sprint Commitment
* Who: the whole team
* Commitment: Engineers show each other their estimates and verify their expectations are aligned.
