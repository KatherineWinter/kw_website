# Engineer to improve the life of cross department partners 

What are some ways that engineering can help improve the work-life of Product, Customer Support, Marketing, Sales, QA, and other engineering teams?

# Product, Marketing, Sales, and Executives

* Keep an open dialog with partners on success metrics. What data can your team provide that would push the organization forward?
* Create analytic dashboards that reflect this data. It's important that the data is easy to access and read.

# QA & Customer Support

* Create a log parser for reading logs and diagnousing problems
* Create a log uploader that users can send their logs to
* Create a support page that can use the log parser to scan logs and suggest solutions to customers
* Store error codes your application finds as it is running. Launch your troubleshooting page with solutions to these problems.
* Keep automated tests up to date

# Other engineering departments

* Keep onboarding documentation up to date
* Always be improving your CLI commands
* Have as much automation as possible
    * Auto code formatting (linting)
    * Automated tests
    * Automated setup
* Keep code clean
* Keep tooling simple

There are a lot of ways you can empower your organization to grow.
