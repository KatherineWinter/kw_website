## Tell me about it

When needing to have a performance conversation, bring up the evidence and append "Tell me about it." Then be quiet. "By saying 'Tell me about it,' you are opening the door to possibilities. This approach provides room in conversations for the other person to give you their perspective." (Green, 2013).

Example: "Mia, I've noticed you have a number of reports on your desk that were scheduled to be finished and turned in last week. Tell me about it."

## Paraphrasing

"Use the context of the situation to paraphrase what has been said and leverage that in a new direction." (Green, 2013). Include the boundary of the situation ("given our current budget..."). Use open-ended questions, which are questions that lead to more than yes/no. Use a plural noun in the open-ended question. (e.g., ideas rather than idea- "What **ideas** do you have for solving the problem?"). Use exploratory language to encourage new thoughts and viewpoints (might, if, could, consider, maybe, perhaps).

Formula: Paraphrase + boundary + open-ended question (with plural noun).

Examples: 

* "We have a lot of projects that could help us grow our team. Given our current budget situation, which of our projects is the highest priority?"
* "*If* the funding is approved, what priorities *could* you focus on?"

**Employee:** I just don't know how you think I'm going to meet these goals, considering the lack of support I've been receiving from the people in purchasing.

**Manager:** *(paraphrase)* Our department's relationship with the purchasing function has been a challenge to meeting our objectives in the past. *(frame)* That hurdle doesn't change the fact that we are all expected to meet our quarterly goals and work together. *(open-ended question with plural nouns)* What ideas do you have for building a stronger relationship with purchasing so that you can more effectively get your work completed on time?

### Sound Bites from the Field

During the conversation with Judi, Kristy framed her questions with the current reality facing the organization. Part of their conversation sounded like this:

**Kristy:** Judi, the downsizing process has been tough on everyone. We've lost staff, and it's unlikely that those positions will be refilled. Given that staffing levels are not predicted to grow, what ideas do you have for meeting our increasing demand?

**Judi:** Oh, I don't know. I guess I'll just need to suck it up and work harder.

**Kristy:** We are all going to have to find new ways of doing our work. Knowing that the job is unlikely to change, what can you do to adapt to the new work-load?

**Judi:** I don't know. There's just so much of it. I think we just need more people.

**Kristy:** Considering that increased staffing is not an option right now, what other options have you considered?

**Judi:** Hmm... I'm wondering if there are some tasks that are just not going to get done anymore. For example, my weekly summary report takes a lot of time to prepare, and I wonder if it's useful to anyone anymore.

**Kristy:** There may be certain tasks that take a lot of your time and were helpful in the past but are not essential now. The weekly summary may be one of those tasks. What else have you considered?

Judi struggled to come up with productive answers to some of the questions.
Eventually, though, she shared several productive ideas that would begin to alleviate the pressure. Kristy effectively used questions to guide Judi to an understanding that the work environment and the expectations for performance would remain unchanged.

She also made it clear that Judi was responsible for identifying steps for adapting to the new environment.
The open-ended, thought-provoking questions posed by Kristy provided a spark that led Judi to consider new options. In the end, Judi was more willing to let go of tasks when she came up with the idea herself.
