# Coaching

## Problem focused questions

1. Tell me about the problem
2. What other problems is this problem causing?
3. How did it get like this?
4. Where does the fault lie?
5. Why will this be really difficult to overcome?
6. Why does this keep happening?

## Solution focused questions

1. Describe Future Perfect
2. On a scale from 1-10 (where 10 is Future Perfect), where are you now?
3. What's helped you achieve so much already?
4. What would take you a small step (say, one point) higher?
5. What would be the first tiny signs of progress?
6. How will you celebrate when you achieve that next step?
