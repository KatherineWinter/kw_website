# Feedback buddies 
This document covers the peer to peer feedback model “feedback buddies”.

## What is a feedback buddy?
A feedback buddy is a peer who interacts with you and the rest of your coworkers on a daily basis. You are their feedback buddy too. It’s a partnership of trust.
* They observe you in meetings. 
* They observe your work.
* They give feedback on a set day of the week.

Feedback buddies are not managers. They are peers who want to help each other grow in their career.


## Friday Feedback

The best kind of feedback is delivered immediately. However, sometimes a situation can be too raw, and time needs to heal what happened. For those cases, and also general feedback, should be given on a set day. This isn’t a hard rule, but a general guideline. Having a set day for feedback to be coming in/out allows an individual to be prepared for receiving feedback. It removes the feeling of being blindsided. Fridays are a good day because it gives an opportunity for your buddy to process or take action on the feedback.

## Why is getting feedback helpful?
* Career growth
* Teaches leadership skills
* Creates material for annual reviews / self reflection
* Creates a relationship of trust

### Career growth
Understanding where you are currently and how you can improve in an actionable way is one of the best ways to grow. Self reflecting is difficult and sometimes leads to incorrect conclusions. Having objective external feedback allows for growing in the areas that need improvement.

### Teaches leadership skills
Leadership skills:
* Giving feedback
* Growing teammates
* Accountable for others success
* Force multiplying
The art of feedback is a core leadership skill. When you are giving feedback to someone, you are growing the other person. While your feedback buddy’s actions aren’t a complete reflection of your efforts; you will get some credit for their growth if it’s based off your feedback. When your teammate is more successful, the team is more successful, and the company is more successful.

### Creates material for annual reviews / self reflection
The annual end of the year self reflection becomes easier if you have a concrete list of feedback throughout the year. You can include the feedback and the steps you took to address the feedback.

### Creates a relationship of trust
Your feedback buddy and you will grow together. You have each others best interest in mind. This is someone you can turn to for another view.

## What does feedback look like?
There isn’t a hard rule of what form feedback can come in. A general feedback skeleton would be:
1. What the person did well
1. What the person can improve
1. Overall

### Feedback Example
Hi Ryan, it’s Friday which means… feedback time!

#### The Good
I think you did an excellent job in the meetings this week. When Sandra seemed confused about the expectations for the project, you did an excellent job of course correcting the situation. I really liked how you asked her what her current understand of the project was before trying to guide her. That shows artful skills in emotional intelligence.

#### Areas of improvement
You get really excited about projects, and execute on them very quickly. I think you could improve our organization by force multiplying your efforts by explaining or documenting as you go along. That way, if you are on PTO, we aren’t completely lost. It is a good opportunity for you to show you leadership skills, by making leaders out of others.

#### Overall
You are an AWESOME teammate. I love how you care about the success of this project. That excitement really is contagious!
