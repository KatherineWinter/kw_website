# Development Process: Feature Complete
The purpose of this document is to outline the Feature Complete development process. Feature Complete is when a feature meets the criteria listed below.

The Goal of Feature Complete
* Always be release ready
* Control quality

## High level
* Development, Test, acceptance happens in branch off of master.
* The developer doesn't have to worry about external changes - until they merge down, but then they KNOW the source of the problem.
* QA can test a non-changing environment.
* Once ALL acceptable bugs are completed, it's merged into the master line. This keeps our master "release ready".
* If a feature misses its due date, no worries, it isn't in master and no worries about the knock-on of moving it out.
* Having features implemented in isolation â€” copy up is explicitly sign off that at least min-ship has been meant.
* All this controls quality.

## Definition of terms
* Workflow design: Document created by Producer and/or designer that defines behavior and user stories of a feature.
* Feature: A collection of User Stories directly from the Workflow design
* Sandbox: Child branch of master. Features are developed here
* Production Sign-off: Producer has approved feature for release.
