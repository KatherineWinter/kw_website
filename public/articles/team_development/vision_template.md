# Vision Template

What is a 'vision' document? A document describes a compelling idea, project or other future state for a particular organization, product or service. Consumers of the document are customers, and must ‘buy in’ to the idea for it to be an effective vision. Vision is a mission. A vision shows how short term work connects with the long term.

> An effective vision helps folks think beyond the constraints of their local maxima, and lightly aligns progress without requiring tight centralized coordination.


## A good vision is composed of

**Vision statement**
A one or two sentence aspirational statement to summarize the rest of the document.

**Value proposition**
How will you be valuable to your users and to your company? What kinds of success will you enable them to achieve?

**Capabilities**
What capabilities will the product need in order to deliver on this value proposition? (Will it need to deliver against the needs of several distinct customer cohorts?)

**Solved constraints** 
What are the constraints of today that won’t exist in the future?

**Future constraints** 
What are the constraints of this future?

**Reference materials**
All related documents

**Narrative**
Synthesize the above into no more than a page.
