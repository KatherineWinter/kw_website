Ryan and I love to travel. We have been all over the place.

## 2021: Mooney flight - Orlando to west coast

We documented our trip on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/binnsflight) and Instragram (#binnsflight).

### Our gear

[Garmin 010-01879-01 InReach Mini](https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Lightweight-Handheld-Satellite-Communicator/dp/B07CR8D2DW/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=garmin+inreach&qid=1633098848&sr=8-3)
