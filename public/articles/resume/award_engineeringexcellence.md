> Katherine Winter is a software engineer on the Frostbite UI team at Tiburon. She has a tremendous passion for working with Frostbite's game team partners to build the engine collaboratively. 

> As an avid member of the “Managing Divergence Effectively” workshops, she proactively identified divergence hotspots in game team code and recommended new workflows to help shape the engine together and reduce the need for those divergences. She's also been enthusiastic about collaborating with our game team partners to harvest new features into the Frostbite code base.

> Most recently, performance tracking is another area where her efforts have been appreciated. This involves quite a bit of coordination with our game teams and data analysts to monitor performance drift across code bases and surface the results in an intelligible way. Coordinating with game teams to run automated performance tracking is a great way to set up Frostbite and our partners for future success.
